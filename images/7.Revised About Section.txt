  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>Weâ€™re a small but passionate team with one mission: 
       <strong>help startups launch fastâ€”without sacrificing security or quality.</strong></p>

    <p>Our team brings together two key strengths:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web & Mobile App Development:</strong> A maker who lives and breathes code, 
          fluent across languages, platforms, and tools, with a passion for building apps 
          that actually work for real users.</li>
      <li><strong>Security & DevSecOps:</strong> A security-focused professional, certified project manager, 
          and Lean Six Sigma Black Beltâ€”experienced in weaving security into the 
          development process from day one.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Weâ€™ve been in your shoes. As founders of a SaaS business ourselves, 
       we know what it feels like to waste time and money on faulty code, 
       broken stacks, and unreliable development partners. 
       Those setbacks cost us opportunitiesâ€”and weâ€™re here to make sure 
       you never go through the same.</p>

    <p>Thatâ€™s why our approach is different: 
       <em>we build apps that are secure by design, 
       delivered with transparency, and crafted with startup realities in mind.</em></p>

    <p>Highlights from our journey so far:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Led a live webinar on application security & shifting left, helping developers rethink how they build securely.</li>
      <li>Successfully launched and operated SaaS products, gaining first-hand experience of startup challenges.</li>
      <li>Blended technical expertise with process excellenceâ€”so you get the speed of a startup 
          with the reliability of enterprise-grade practices.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>If youâ€™re a startup founder or CTO under pressure to ship quickly, 
       weâ€™d love to help you launch strong, secure, and ready to scale.</p>
