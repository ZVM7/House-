<!-- ABOUT -->
<section id="about">
  <h2>About Us</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <p>We‚Äôre a boutique studio founded by makers who believe in quality over quantity. 
       Unlike large agencies that juggle dozens of clients, we focus on <strong>one project at a time</strong>. 
       This means you get direct access to the people building your product‚Äîno account managers, 
       no hidden subcontractors.</p>

    <p>Our team blends two passions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Web & Mobile Development:</strong> Crafting apps that work flawlessly across devices and platforms.</li>
      <li><strong>Security & Process Excellence:</strong> Bringing DevSecOps practices, project management, 
          and lean methodology to every build.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>We know what it‚Äôs like to be let down by unreliable dev partners. 
       As SaaS founders ourselves, we‚Äôve felt the frustration of buggy code, broken stacks, 
       and wasted opportunities. That‚Äôs why we built this studio: 
       to give startups the boutique partner we always wished we had.</p>
